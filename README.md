# Thermal Energy Storage System Simulation

## Project Overview
This project simulates a simple thermal energy storage system, modeling heat transfer and energy stored in a medium (e.g., water) over time. The simulation allows for temperature changes and heat losses to the environment.

### Features
- Simulates energy stored in a medium
- Models heat losses over time
- Plots system temperature and energy profiles

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/Thermal-Energy-Storage-Simulation.git`
2. Install dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib`
3. Run the simulation: `python src/simulation.py`

### Dependencies
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
